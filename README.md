# Electronegativity

This is a custom fork of Doyensec's great [Electronegativity](https://github.com/doyensec/electronegativity) for my bachelor's thesis. It has been modified to report all configurations, not just insecure ones, among other things.

The code for my analysis is available [here](https://github.com/baltpeter/thesis-electron-analysis-src).

**Unless you want to replicate my results, you should not be using this fork but rather the [“official” version](https://github.com/doyensec/electronegativity).**
